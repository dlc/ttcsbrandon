<p>Greetings My Friends:</p>
 
<p>Here is your link to the Tampa Bay area newsletter:</p>
 
<p><a href="http://Dunedin.florida.usa.taoist.org/pdf/201304issue04.pdf">http://Dunedin.florida.usa.taoist.org/pdf/201304issue04.pdf</a></p>
 
<p>Kris Holmes from the St. Pete branch has taken over from Roger Boese of Dunedin, the coordinating and publishing of the newsletter.  Thank you Kris.</p>

<p>During the transition from Roger to Kris, the Bay area did not receive an April issue of the newsletter.  The May issue contains Roger's input before he moved.</p>
 
<p>There's a wonderful story submitted by Mike Murphy of the Sarasota branch on his impressions of Fung Loy Kok (FLK) in Orangeville, the Society's International Center outside of Toronto.</p>
 
<p>A little side note from the Society's International website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Fung Loy Kok Institute of Taoism observes the unified teachings of the three religions of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism. Its mission is to deliver all from suffering, both the living and the dead, by pursuing the way of community service, rituals and ceremonies, and the cultivation of body and mind.</p>

<p>Fung Loy Kok promotes the principle of all cultures and religions moving together in harmony. Individuals of all backgrounds and beliefs are welcome to become members of Fung Loy Kok.</p>

<p>The religion of Taoism emphasizes spiritual development through cultivation of both mind and body, with the ultimate goal of achieving harmony within oneself and with the world.</p>

<p>There are three main aspects of Taoist practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>performing good deeds,</li>
<li>rituals and ceremonies, and</li>
<li>arts of internal transformation ("internal alchemy").</li>
<ol>

<p>As taught by Fung Loy Kok, the foundation of this religious practice is established through the Taoist Tai Chi&copy; arts which include arts of movement such as Tai Chi, Lok Hup Ba Fa, Tai Chi Sword and Tai Chi Sabre, community service, Taoist meditation, and Taoist chanting and ceremonies.</p>

<p>Members will have the opportunity to participate in any and all components of this training as they choose.</p>

<p>Happy Mother's Day to all, since none of us would be here without Mothers.  Bless the women!</p>
 
<p>Our big event is coming up quickly, that's the International Tai Chi workshop May 25 and 26.  The workshop will be led by Jim Nicholson of Vancouver who just happens to be on the FLK Board of Directors.  Workshops are Society fundraisers which help to pay for the programs in Orangeville and to pay for things such as the purchase and upkeep of buildings just like the ones we are lucky to have here in Brandon, St. Pete, Dunedin, and Sarasota.  The donation for this workshop is $175 (whether you attend 2 hours or all 5 sessions&mdash;again, it' a fundraiser) with meals $25 extra.  The meals will all be cooked in our kitchen under the guidance of our Executive Director, Sean Dennison, who is also on the FLK Board of Directors.  We have members coming from Tallahassee and other local branches just to help out with the cooking.  One lady is coming from Denver just to learn how to properly use their new kitchen.</p>
 
<p>Our next breakfast will be on Friday, May 31 At 8 am.  We've had about 30-35 show up for the previous breakfasts and we'd love to get 50 regularly.  Cost is $5 and it's a nice opportunity to meet students from other classes.  Stay afterwards for the 9 am continuing class.</p>

<p>In June, the St. Pete branch will be hosting, once again, the Pinellas Chamber Ensemble.  This is a volunteer organization, like the Society, which often plays with the Tampa Orchestra.  One of the St. Pete instructors, Marge Grudzinski, plays piano for them.  They will play on Sunday, June 2 at 2 pm.  Tickets are $10 (we have some at the center) and wines and cheeses will be available.  I believe this is their 3rd visit to the St. Pete branch.  I attended the first one and thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>

<p>On Sunday, June 23 Brandon will have a 3-hour tai chi intensive, a luncheon, and our Branch Annual Meeting (BAM).  The intensive will be led by Ed Bell from Tallahassee, who is a member of the Southeast Regional Management Committee and is the overseer for Brandon.  The BAM is when members to the Branch Council are elected (if a vote is required) and our branch president, Susan Schuler, lists our accomplishments from the previous year and our goals for this new year.  Lunch will be prepared in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Friday, June 28, at 8 am will be the June breakfast.  If you've noticed, we are trying to have a breakfast the last Friday of every month.  Plan ahead and come join us.</p>

<p>From the Quiet Cultivation Center 3 Religions Temple on the Orangeville campus.  The red robes are worn by Taoist monks and Taoist chanters (members like us).  Often, when we have a special chanting ceremony in our branches, you will see us wear blue robes during chanting.  These are from the Confucian tradition.  The photo does not give you a perspective on how large the statues in the background really are.  You'll just have to make a trip there to see for yourself!</p>

<p>Please be well and play more tai chi&mdash;your body will love you for it.</p>
